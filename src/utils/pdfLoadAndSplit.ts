/**
 * This PDF Loader and Splitter is designed to work with converted PDFs and is not compatible with PDFs generated from scanned documents. 
 * Scanned documents will require separate handling due to their unique conditions.
 *
 * The Langchain PDFLoader used here, which utilizes the PDF loading functionality from the pdf.js library, appends a newline character at the end of each line during text extraction 
 * However, newline characters (\n) often do not coincide with the end of a sentence. 
 * The goal of this code is to mitigate this issue, though it may not entirely eliminate all related problems.
 *
 * Due to the complexity and variability of PDF file structures, particularly those with embedded tables, the current implementation is primarily targeted at handling non-tabular English-language text for  a significantly better outcome than the original Langchain code.
